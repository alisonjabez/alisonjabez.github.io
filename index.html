    </article>
    <h2>2010</h2>
    <article>I  began  interacting   which  computers.
        I have  so  far  used  MICROSOFT  WINDOWS  OS
        I  was  interested   in  learning  the  microsoft 
         office  and  all  it  entails
        
        </article>
        <h2>2018</h2>
        <article>I  learned  my  first  programming  language  and  that  was  scratch  desktop.
            I  had   an  ambition  of   becoming  a  software  engineer.
            I  had  the  morale  of  leaning  various  programming  languages.
             Towards  the   end  of  the   year   I  got  interest  in  learning   HTML  and  Javascript.
            </article>
            <h2>2019</h2>
            <article>I  went  to  my  first  science  and  engineering  fair.i  was  very 
                 innovative  and  I  had  an  idea  of   making  a  survailance  drone 
                  that  can  be  used  for  security  .
                I  programed  the  drone  using  scatch  desktop  and  it  achieved  al  
                the  missions  I  had  set  it  to  do.
                I  did  not  go  far I  failed  at  the  county  levels  as  the  judges 
                 failed  to   understand  what  I  had  innovated   and  how  I  used  scratch 
                  desktop  to  achieve  that.
                </article>

<h2>2020</h2>
<article>The  year  began  well on  my  side  and  I  had  a  project  of  digital 
     weather  station  that  can  be  used  to  monitor  weather  of  a  poultry 
      farm  and  sends    real  time SMS  to  the  owner  of  the  farm.
    The  system  also  had  a  corrective  mechanism  that  corrects  the  weather 
     conditions  just  incase  it    is  above  or  below  the  required   limit  .
    I  achieved  this  through  the  use  of  sensors  a  micro  controller  and  a 
     GSM  module.
    I  programmed  the  microcontroller  using  an  IDE  in  javascript.
